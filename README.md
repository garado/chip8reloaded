# chip8reloaded
![](img/combined.gif)

This is based on a chip8 emulator I made a few months ago. It's got a Raspberry Pi Zero W using an [led matrix library](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) for the graphics and uses the keyboard + command line for controls. 

# To do list
- Play sound through the terminal
- Figure and preset the clock rate for each game (because they all perform best at different clock rates)
- Have a nice splash screen loaded during game selection
- Scrollable and prettier menu pages
- Find out why it segfaults on certain games :(
- Add a rainbow display mode :)
- Add option to return to game selection while ingame instead of quitting the program entirely
